Hi, this is a basic group chat application implemented with socket.io.

Here are the steps to try and run the application.
1. Make sure you have express, socket.io and nodemon in your system.
   If not, run these commands:
   a. npm install --save express
   b. npm install --save socket.io
   c. npm install --save-dev nodemon
2. download this repo to your local system.
3. Go to the directory with index.html file.
4. Run the following command to start the application:
   npm run dev
5. Go to your browser, open localhost with port 4000.
6. Now, open two or more tabs to make it feel like there are more than one member in your group applications.
7. Type your messages and enjoy!!

Skills used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, socket.io.

Thanks!!
